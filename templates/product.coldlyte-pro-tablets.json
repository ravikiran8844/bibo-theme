It activates the receptors in the blood vessels of the nasal mucosa that causes constriction of the blood vessels. The constricted blood vessels cause decreased inflammation (by shrinking the inflamed tissues) and increased drainage of the sinus cavity.<\/p><p>Chlorpheniramine is an anti-allergic (anti-histaminic).
